        <h2>Program Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>4+1 Dual Degree Engineering Program</strong> is a partnership between
            <strong>Saint Mary’s College</strong> and the <strong>University of Notre Dame</strong> that enables students
            to earn two degrees in just five years: a Bachelor of Science in Computing and Applied Mathematics (CAM)
            and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This program combines the strengths of a liberal arts
            education with top-tier engineering training.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Choose the 4+1 Dual Degree Program?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Two Degrees, One Cohesive Path:</strong> Students graduate with both a CAM degree from Saint Mary’s and a CS degree from Notre Dame, opening doors in both industry and academia.</li>
            <li><strong>Accelerated Timeline:</strong> Complete both degrees in five years instead of the traditional six or more, saving time and tuition costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Interdisciplinary Foundation:</strong> The CAM program strengthens mathematical reasoning and analytical thinking while CS training at Notre Dame builds strong technical skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Advising from Two Institutions:</strong> Dual advising teams help students navigate course selection, research opportunities, internships, and the transition between campuses.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanded Career Opportunities:</strong> Graduates are uniquely positioned for careers in software engineering, data science, tech consulting, and graduate studies in engineering or applied mathematics.</li>
            <li><strong>Access to Resources:</strong> Take advantage of student organizations, career centers, research labs, and internship networks at both Saint Mary’s and Notre Dame.</li>
            <li><strong>Small Class Sizes + Big Campus Access:</strong> Benefit from personalized attention at Saint Mary’s while gaining experience with Notre Dame’s new technology and infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
