        <h3>Transfer Life</h3>
        <p>
          Every student brings a unique journey to Notre Dame, and transferring is no exception.
          Building a strong sense of community and making the most of available resources—both before and after transferring—is key to a smooth and enriching transition.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best ways to integrate into campus life is by getting involved early. As a Saint Mary’s student planning to transfer, you can already participate in many of Notre Dame’s clubs and organizations. These groups offer not only a chance to explore your interests but also to build friendships, mentorships, and professional networks.
